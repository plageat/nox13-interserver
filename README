Pre-requisites
---------------
NOX dependencies are listed in this page  
https://github.com/noxrepo/nox-classic/wiki/Dependencies

The code was compiled and tested under an Ubuntu 11.10. 
To compile it in a later version you should downgrade almost every dependency, so
we recommend, while the code isn't updated, to use an older system version.

To compile interserver component you need libmicrohttpd >= 0.9.22 
installed in yuor system(/usr/local/lib).

Getting Started
---------------

To build, run the following commands in the of11softswitch directory:

    ./boot.sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure --with-python=no
    make


To start the controller, run the following commands:

    cd build/src
    ./nox-core -i ptcp:<port> [applications]

This will start the controller, listening on the given port for switch
connetions. For a complete list of options, use the --help argument.
