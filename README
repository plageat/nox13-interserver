Getting Started
---------------

Requires: libmicrohttpd >= 0.9.22 (in /usr/local/lib)

To build, run the following commands in the nox13 directory:

    ./boot.sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure --with-python=no
    make


To start the controller with http server, run the following commands:

    cd build/src
    ./nox-core -i ptcp:<port> interserver request_processor [interact_components_list]

This will start the controller, listening on the given port for switch
connetions. For a complete list of options, use the --help argument.
